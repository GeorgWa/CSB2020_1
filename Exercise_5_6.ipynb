    "\n",
    "As the current Sars-CoV-2 Pandemic unfolds, research groups around the world are trying to model the dynamics of the ongoing Pandemic. Epediemiological models are needed to forecast the infections, guide policy makers and probe interventions measures. Even though multiple approaches have been implemented to elucidate different facets of the Pandemic, most models are based on the same SEIR [2] framework. The population of interest is seperated into different compartements, based on theil contact with the pathogen. Susceptible (S) People can become exposed (E), which can lead to an succsesfull infection with the virus. Infected (I) Population can then further infect susceptible indivisuals until recovery (R). As described the SEIR model assumes immunity after overcomming the infection.\n",

    "##### The Neher Model - COVID-19 Dynamics\n",
    "The research group from the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, led by Richard Neher, developed a model to simulate the current Sars-CoV-2 Pandemic [1]. The Model is based on the described SEIR  framework, which was extended to account for the specific questions of interest in the current Pandemic. A special focus was set to asses the strain on the healthcare system and to model the capacity overflow on ICU units. Furthermore, the effect on different age groups can be assessed and the isolation of age groups can be modeled with high fidelity. and the effect of seasonal forcing on the spread of infection can be simulated [3]. The model was published as an interactive web application which freely accessible and lets the user explore fitted parameters based on observational data and custom parameters [4]. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Colizza Model\n",
    "Another group of researchers arround Laura Di Domenico from the INSERM [5] also created a model to describe the Sars-CoV-2 Pandemic. The base for the model is also a modified SEIR framework. It is extended to bring in the contacts between people and the different behaviours of infected perople into calculation.  \n",
    "At the moment, europe and the world are currently under strict social distancing measures. It is not clear, how the different countries can reduce the strict counter measures against the virus, without running into a second wave.  \n",
    "Therefor the paper addresses the question, what influence have the applied counter measures on the development of the pandemi and what are possible exit strategies to get out of the lockdown in a save way.  \n",
    "The paper is published as a pre-print and publicly available [6]. It contains information about the model and the used parameter but does not publish the sources."

    "The state is split into the prodromic phase ($I_p$), followed by four states, repersenting the severity of  Asymptomatic Infectious state ($I_{a}$), Paucysymptomatic Infectious($I_{ps}$), Symptomatic Infectious ($I_{ms}$) and the state for Symptomatic Infectious with severe symptoms ($I_{ss}$).  \n",
    "The first three states show a mild course after infection. The different states are used to model the behaviour of affected people in more detail. With the parameters it is possible to represent the selfisolation because of the illness. It is assumed that, during a sever illness, people reduce their contacts by 75% [7].  \n",
    "All people in state $I_{ss}$ have a stay in the hospital, either in the normal tracks or in the ICU.  \n",
